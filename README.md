1. Download and install Montreal Forced Aligner and Praat. Your input folder should contain audio files and text transcript files formatted with the same name. For example: audio_1.wav and audio_1.txt.
2. Run mfa_pipeline(audio_dir, language_model_dir, dictionary, output_dir, new_mfa_data=True) locally to generate TextGrid files for each of the audio files.
3. Upload the audio and text transcript files to /natural-speech-processing/quantifying-redundancy/languages/en/wav_files/all and the TextGrid files to /natural-speech-processing/quantifying-redundancy/languages/en/aligned/all.
4. Run /natural-speech-processing/quantifying-redundancy/to_work_with_for_prominence/scripts/extract_prominence.sh on OpenMind to extract prominence, which will be saved to /natural-speech-processing/quantifying-redundancy/languages/en/cache_prominence, and utilize /natural-speech-processing/quantifying-redundancy/to_work_with_for_prominence/debug_prominence_en.ipynb to inspect the outputs and generate a csv file to download locally.
5. Run process_multiple_files_for_feature("all", input_folder, output_folder, language_model_dir, dictionary, praat_location, new_mfa_data=new_mfa_data, prominence_file=prominence_file) locally.
